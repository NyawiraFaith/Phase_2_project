# King County House Sales Prediction
## INTRODUCTION
This project aims to analyze the King County property market and identify factors influencing housing prices. We will provide valuable insights for prospective homeowners and investors.

## BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING
Our stakeholder is a real estate agency that helps homeowners buy and/or sell homes.
In King County, there is a crucial need to assist homeowners in understanding how home renovations can impact the prices of their houses. Our project aims to address this need by providing practical insights into the factors that influence property values. By analyzing the data and utilizing predictive modeling techniques, we can identify the specific renovations that have the potential to increase the value of homes and generate favorable returns. Armed with this information, homeowners can make informed decisions about their renovations, optimizing their investment and maximizing their return on investment. Our analysis aims to empower homeowners in King County to navigate the real estate market confidently and make strategic choices to enhance the value of their properties.

## DATA UNDERSTANDING
The data used in this project was obtained from this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction). It contains data for Kings County houses from 2014-2015.

## DATA PREPARATION
We performed essential data preparation steps to ensure the quality and reliability of our dataset. This involved addressing outliers using appropriate techniques and handling missing values through imputation methods. We also conducted a thorough check for duplicate records to maintain data integrity. Additionally, data visualization played a crucial role in understanding the distribution and relationships within the dataset, allowing us to uncover meaningful patterns and gain insights for further analysis and modeling. These data preparation steps were vital in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of our data for the subsequent stages of our project.

Overall, our data preparation process involved outlier handling, missing value imputation, duplicate checks, and data visualization. By following these steps, we ensured that our dataset was carefully examined, cleaned, and ready for subsequent analysis.

## MODELLING
We initially built a basic linear regression model to establish a baseline. This provided us with crucial information such as R^2 value, RSME, F-statistic, feature colinearity, and error measurements, which are vital in assessing the quality and performance of the regression model.

## REGRESSION RESULTS
In our analysis, we found that several factors were associated with house prices. The grade of a property had a positive relationship with price, indicating that higher-grade homes tended to have higher prices. However, the presence of a waterfront did not show a significant impact on price. The number of bathrooms had a positive correlation with price, suggesting that having more bathrooms may contribute to higher property values. Furthermore, the year a house was built was found to potentially influence its price. These results provide valuable insights into the factors that may affect house prices in our analysis.

## RECOMMENDATIONS
* Enhance property grade: Improving the overall quality and aesthetics of the property can potentially increase its value.
  
* Upgrade bathrooms: Renovating or adding bathrooms can contribute to higher property values and appeal to potential buyers.
  
* Assess waterfront impact: Evaluate the significance of waterfront features on property value, considering factors such as location and desirability.
  
* Maintain and update older properties: Regular maintenance and updating of older properties can help maximize their value in the market.
